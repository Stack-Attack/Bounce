# BOUNCE

This app was made using:
-Visual Studio
-Phaser
-Illuminated.js
-Phaser transitions plugin
-Crosswalk
-Apache Cordova

It is, and can be run as, a stardard cordova app. This means it will run in browser or as a completed APK.

You control by moving your input around the screen.

The object of the game is the bounce the ball as many times as possible



Due to limitations with Illuminated.js the light source intensity could not be adjusted without significant drops in framerate.
